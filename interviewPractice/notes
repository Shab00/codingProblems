[Intro — 20–25s] Hi, I’m Bashaar Dhoot. I’m currently completing an MSc in Computing at The Open University and I’m applying for the Engineering Development Group Software Development Internship at MathWorks. Over the last five years I’ve been building small apps and tools that turn numerical ideas into user‑facing workflows — that experience motivated my dissertation work and drives my interest in EDG.

[Why MathWorks & motivation — 35–40s] What excites me about MathWorks is the emphasis on turning algorithms into reliable tools that engineers and scientists actually use. EDG’s mix of prototyping, product quality, and collaboration matches how I like to work: prototype quickly, then harden with tests, CI, and clear interfaces so teams can rely on the result. I want to develop features and automated tests for real products and learn from the team’s MATLAB and Simulink expertise.

[Dissertation — DetectingBrainTumours — 55–65s] My MSc dissertation, DetectingBrainTumours, is a MATLAB prototype built with the Image Processing Toolbox and App Designer. I implemented a preprocessing pipeline — Gaussian denoising, background subtraction, and contrast normalisation — followed by segmentation experiments and morphological post‑processing. I wrapped the algorithms in an App Designer GUI so clinical reviewers could step through each stage, compare parameter choices, and reproduce results. I also built a small test harness for the data transformations and logging so we could trace parameters to outcomes. This project taught me how to design reproducible experiments, and how a GUI can make algorithmic decisions accessible to non‑technical users.

[Earlier apps & long‑term experience (5 years) — 45–50s] For the five years before my dissertation I built productivity and analysis apps for coursework and colleagues. These were quick‑turn prototypes that focused on usability and deterministic outputs — for example, I created an automated data cleaning and report generator that saved a lab team several hours per week. Those projects taught me to balance shipping fast with keeping code maintainable and well‑documented.

[Engineering practices & backend work — 45–50s] On the infrastructure side, I’ve built Dockerised FastAPI microservices and set up CI pipelines to run tests on every merge. In another project I led a correctness‑first C implementation where we used unit testing and defensive checks to reduce runtime failures. These experiences reinforced habits I’ll bring to EDG: automated tests, reproducible environments, and clear APIs between components.

[How I fit the role — 30–35s] I’m comfortable in MATLAB and Python, and I have experience with object‑oriented design. I can implement algorithm prototypes and then help harden them with unit and integration tests — exactly the sort of feature‑to‑product lifecycle EDG describes. I’m also eager to pick up C++, JavaScript or Go as needed and I enjoy learning new tech quickly.

[Behavioral / impact story (STAR condensed) — 55–65s] One example of leadership and impact: I led the development of that automated report generator. Situation: the lab manually cleaned and collated data each week. Task: automate the workflow and make outputs reproducible. Action: I gathered requirements with users, implemented the cleaning pipeline, wrote tests for every transform, and added documentation and a simple UI. Result: the team’s manual processing time dropped by roughly 60%, onboarding became faster, and the pipeline was easier to audit — I learned to prioritize features and communicate technical trade‑offs to non‑technical stakeholders.

[Technical challenge (brief) — 35–40s] A quick technical challenge I solved during my dissertation: segmentation produced many false positives in some scans. I ran controlled ablation tests, added morphological post‑processing, and tuned local thresholding based on contrast metrics. I used the GUI to validate changes visually. This reduced false positives and made the results easier for clinicians to interpret.

[Closing: availability & interest — 20–25s] I’m available for a three‑ to four‑month internship starting June/July 2026. I’d welcome the chance to contribute to EDG, learn from MathWorks’ engineers, and continue turning algorithms into reliable, testable tools. Thank you for your time — I’d be happy to answer any follow up questions.
